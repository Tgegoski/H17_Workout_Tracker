# H17_Workout_Tracker

The purpose of this assignment is to create a workout tracker. This application uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express. This application allows the user to keep track of their daily workouts and their duration.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view, create, and track my daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I want to also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of each exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

Many studies have shown that a user will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Technologies Used

MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node, Mongo Atlas, Morgan and Heroku.


## Acceptance Criteria

The user should be able to:

  * Create a new workout or continue with their last workout upon loading the page.

  * Add new exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
